# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue (credentials exposure, token handling issues, etc.), please do not open a public issue.
Report it privately via GitHub to the maintainer.

## Sensitive Data Handling
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets to the repository.
- Use environment variables for credentials and tokens.
- Keep logs free of post/comment bodies by default.
